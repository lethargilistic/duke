TODO
----
* [CHECK] Player can choose to place a token from their bag instead of moving
* [CHECK] Player can place the starting footman in custom way
* [CHECK] Implement Strike movement --- Only lands on enemy pieces. Not same as normal
* [CHECK] Implement Normal movement (different from Jump)
* [CHECK] Implement JumpSlide movement
* Implement Defense movement
* Implement Dread movement
* [CHECK] Implement Command movement filtering
* Implement the actual Command movement (placing chosen ally on another command space)
* TESTING
* [CHECK] Getters & setters -> pythonic properties
* [CHECK] Move game loop into controller from main
* test movement that will be blocked on the x, y, and xy axes.
* Real GUI layer (maybe pygame)
* filter command so that if all the spaces are full, command is not an option.

KNOWN BUGS
----------
* Player 2's movement with MoveRule Command may not be mirrored. (same as player 1)
* Player 2's movement not mirrored in general. Suspect that the mirroring is
  happening twice, so it seems to not be happening. Too tired right now.
